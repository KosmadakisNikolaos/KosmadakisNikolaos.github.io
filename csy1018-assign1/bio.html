<h1>About me</h1>
<br />
<p>
Since I was a kid i was very intersted in gaining knowledge in almost every little thing
in my life.<br /> I wanted ton learn everyting about computers and electronic devices <br />
What began as a diversion truly turned into a fixation so i decided to become a computer programmer.<br />
I am a first year student in <a href="http://www.northampton.ac.uk/study/courses/computing-bsc-hons/">University of Northampton in BSc (Hons) Computing</a> and i work as <br/>
a part time Database Administrator.<br/>I am very fond of various programming languages such as <br />
SQL,Python,Java and a few other</p>


<h2>My hobbies</h2>
<p>
When I was nine years old I had my first <a href="http://www.enaliosscuba.gr/" title="One of the best scuba diving school in my opinion">Scuba-diving</a><br/>
expirience.Later at the age of thirteen I started doing<a href="http://naokth.gr/"> sailing </a> <br />
courses and taking part in races  which really excites even nowdays despite the fact i have grown up. <br />
Moreover i like listening to music,hanging around with my friends which relaxes me mostly at all.<br />
A huge fan of Tarantino's movies and a poetry lover.
